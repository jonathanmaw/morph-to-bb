morph-to-bb notes
=================

What data is provided in a morph, and how can it be compared to a recipe?

DEFAULTS
--------

### build-systems

Many of these have equivalent classes in bitbake that can be inherited.
Others will be a matter of manually copying the commands.

### split-rules

bitbake has sensible defaults. If necessary, I can override it.

CHUNKS
------

name
kind
configure-commands
build-commands
install-commands

Chunks are bitbake packages, usually one is specified in one .bb file.

Simple information here, slightly more complex when I'm merging it
with the data stored in strata.

STRATA
------

name
kind
build-depends:
- morph
chunks:
- name
- morph
- repo
- ref
- unpetrify-ref
- build-system
- build-depends:

A stratum is a packagegroup, which DEPENDS and RDEPENDS on all the
chunks (packages) within.
morph refers to a file that contains the rest of the chunk definition.
the name fields must match.
Chunks DEPENDS on the strata (packagegroup) that this straum depends on.
Chunks DEPENDS and RDEPENDS on the other chunks listed here.
build-system may mean 'inherit'ing a bbclass.

SYSTEMS
-------

name
kind
description
arch
strata:
- name
- morph
configuration-extensions:

I have no idea what to do with arch, currently.
A system RDEPENDS on all strata listed.
morph refers to a file path, name must match.
I have no idea what to do with configuration-extensions, currently.
